IN CRYPTANALYSIS, FREQUENCY ANALYSIS IS THE STUDY OF THE FREQUENCY OF LETTERS OR
GROUPS OF LETTERS IN A CIPHERTEXT. THE METHOD IS USED AS AN AID TO BREAKING
CLASSICAL CIPHERS.

FREQUENCY ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT, IN ANY GIVEN STRETCH OF WRITTEN
LANGUAGE, CERTAIN LETTERS AND COMBINATIONS OF LETTERS OCCUR WITH VARYING
FREQUENCIES. MOREOVER, THERE IS A CHARACTERISTIC DISTRIBUTION OF LETTERS THAT IS
ROUGHLY THE SAME FOR ALMOST ALL SAMPLES OF THAT LANGUAGE. FOR INSTANCE, GIVEN
A SECTION OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE, E, T, A AND O ARE THE MOST COMMON, WHILE Z, Q AND
X ARE RARE. LIKEWISE, TH, ER, ON, AND AN ARE THE MOST COMMON PAIRS OF LETTERS
(TERMED BIGRAMS OR DIGRAPHS), AND SS, EE, TT, AND FF ARE THE MOST COMMON
REPEATS.[1] THE NONSENSE PHRASE "ETAOIN SHRDLU" REPRESENTS THE 12 MOST FREQUENT
LETTERS IN TYPICAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEXT.

IN SOME CIPHERS, SUCH PROPERTIES OF THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PLAINTEXT ARE PRESERVED
IN THE CIPHERTEXT, AND THESE PATTERNS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE EXPLOITED IN
A CIPHERTEXT-ONLY ATTACK.
