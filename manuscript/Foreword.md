# Foreword

This book is intended to tackle cryptography, and grow one's understanding of
this unique science. Computer Science treats cryptography with a great deal of
mysticism: There is a bit of magic here, don't try to understand it if you are
not a "crypto" expert. If you are a programmer who likes puzzles, this book is
for you. Together we will tour through simple, ancient ciphers up to World War
II's elegant systems.

When I was a kid my favorite car activity was crytpograms. I felt triumph sitting 
in the car rolling over the California mountians fully absorbed in frequency counts
and letter substitutions unlocking each message. This book seeks to rediscover
that sense of triumph. 

Every culture in history believed its secret writing system were "unbreakable" until, 
of course, they were. The triumph of cryptanalysis throughout history adds fascinating depth to cloak and dagger stories.
The hubris of cultres past left them blind to their own vulnerabilities.
I like to think that the greatest thing we can learn from history is to
identify our own current vulnerabilities. 

Crytography has progresed beyond letters and "secret writing" to abstract pure mathematics.
Much to their chagrin, givng pure math an application. However this book looks back at the 
origin of crypto systems. This book is part history, and part interactive fiction. 

This books starts in 1300 and builds up to Enigma in World War 2.
