# Foreword

This book is intended to tackle cryptography, and grow one's understanding of
this unique science. Computer Science treats cryptography with a great deal of
mysticism: There is a bit of magic here, don't try to understand it if you are
not a "crypto" expert. If you are a programmer who likes puzzles, this book is
for you. Together we will tour through simple, ancient ciphers up to World War
II's elegant systems. 

For each system we will design C++ applications to cipher text, and when
appropriate design cracking systems to analyze the weaknesses of the system.
When more power is required, we will deploy our cracking applications on Azure. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. Why are you using Windows, and Microsoft? Are you a fan boy?
Nope. My current job gives me an allowance on Microsoft Azure. I use it because
it's free. 

1. Why are you using Visual Studio for the code?
When I started writing this application, Visual Studio had the only
implementation of C++'s coroutines. By the time you read this, coroutines are
likely implemented in several compilers, but it took a long time to write this book

1. I think I could write the code better than you!
Well, that wasn't a question, but awesome. I'm always trying to be better. Fork
this book on github, and I'll happily merge your request.

1. What are you drinking?
Jameson.
