# Enigma
> ...repetition  is the enemy of security
>> &mdash; Simon Singh regarding Rejewski's strategy to crack enigma

Enigma is perhaps the most famous cipher system in history. The exercise of
nations to find its chinks drove individuals toward their genius. Simon Sighn
said, "if necessity is the mother of invention, then adversity is the mother of
cryptanalysis." 

Enigma existed in several forms over the course of world war 2, and it's
cryptanalyst evolved necessarily. This chapter analyzes Rejewski's novel
approach and follows its evolution over the English channel to Bletchley Park.
This chapter shows how patterns in crypto-systems or patterns in the methods
employed by its users, however well intentioned ultimately weaken a crypto-system.
